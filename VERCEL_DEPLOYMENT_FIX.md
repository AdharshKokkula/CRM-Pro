# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
The build was failing on Vercel with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu
```

This is a known npm bug with optional dependencies not being installed correctly.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Package Dependencies
- **Pinned Vite version** to `5.4.19` (exact version)
- **Added explicit Rollup dependency** `^4.24.0` in devDependencies
- **Added missing date-fns dependency** `^3.6.0` required by TaskCalendarView

### 2. Created .npmrc Configuration
```
fund=false
audit=false
```
This prevents npm warnings and ensures cleaner installs.

### 3. Created vercel.json Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist", 
  "framework": "vite",
  "installCommand": "npm install --include=optional"
}
```
This ensures optional dependencies are properly installed on Vercel.

### 4. Clean Package Structure
- **26 dependencies** (production)
- **15 devDependencies** (development)
- All dependencies properly resolved and tested

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Local build successful: `npm run build`
2. ✅ All dependencies resolved correctly
3. ✅ No missing imports or modules
4. ✅ Production-ready configuration

## Deployment Instructions

1. Push the updated code to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically detect the `vercel.json` configuration
3. The build should now complete successfully
4. The app will be deployed to the `dist` directory

## Key Files Modified

- `package.json` - Fixed dependencies and versions
- `.npmrc` - Added npm configuration
- `vercel.json` - Added Vercel build configuration
- Regenerated `package-lock.json` with proper dependency resolution

The project is now ready for successful deployment on Vercel.
